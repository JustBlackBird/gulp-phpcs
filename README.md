## Reporters

The plugin only pass files through PHP Code Sniffer. To process the results of
the check one should use a reporter. Reporters are plugins too, so one can pipe
a files stream to them. Several repotrers can be used on a stream, just like
any other plugins.

These reporters are shipped with the plugin:

1. Fail reporter - fails if a problem was found. Use
`phpcs.reporter('fail', {failOnFirst: true})` to load it. `failOnFirst` option
is used to choose when the reporter should fail on the first errored file or at
the end of the file stream. This option can be omitted (`true` is used by
default).

2. Log reporter - outputs all problems to the console. Use
`phpcs.reporter('log')` to load it.

3. File reporter - outputs all problems to a file. Use
`phpcs.reporter('file', { path: "path/to/report.txt" })` to load it.
